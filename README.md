# Week-6-7-NBA-Salaries-Project

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wallywanderlust/Week-6-7-NBA-Salaries-Project/main?filepath=nbaproject%20resume.ipynb)

The goal of this project is to analyze the stats from the 2020-2021 NBA season and construct the most accurate predictive model for whether or not players made above the league average salary of $7,689,656 based only on a players stats. The stats were taken from the beginning of the 2020-2021 season up until April 6th. Players excluded from these datasets were players who did not play during the 2020-2021 season or who had no salary information available. Our statistics were taken from basketballreference.com.

The datasets used were the two csv files marked 'salaries csv' and 'player stats csv' which are in this repository. I subsequently cleaned the data and then combined the two dataframes into a single dataframe which is also available in this repository 'NBA Stats and Salaries merge csv file.csv'.

I separated this project into three separate notebooks. The first 'First Draft NBA Project.ipynb' is a Jupyter Notebook which shows the process of me cleaning the data and what my initial insights about the data were. The second notebook 'Second Draft NBA Project.ipynb' is my analysis of the data that I made in the first week of the project. 'NBA Project resume.ipynb' is the complete project, my analysis of the data, use of several predictive models, the explanations of how the predictive models did and predicting who made above average salary and who did not and my overall conclusions.

The Binder button above, if clicked on will open my final project in a Jupyter Notebook and load all the necessary packages. You can interact with it, erase the outputs and run it to make sure it works. Hopefully, people can use my project as a guide or for information, etc. Thanks for reading! -Walter
