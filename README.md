# Week-6-7-NBA-Salaries-Project

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can correctly predict which NBA players make above league average salary based on their statistics of the 2020-2021 season. The greater insight I hoped to have and ultimately did have was to look at the subset of players where the predictive model disagreed with their actual salaries and ask the question whether these players either outperformed or underperformed their respective salaries? I did further analysis of league average stats and stats of those players that were deemed by the predictive model to be 'overperformers' and 'underperformers'. One of the learning goals was to learn how to come up with a question that machine learning could solve and investigate for myself how to structure the project. To this point I had done projects that many other people had already done, this was a project that I created on my own. I took the two datasets from basketballreference.com of players stats and player salaries and combined them. I hope you enjoy the project and perhaps other people learning how to analyze data can use the project as a template to investigate the stats themselves, not only for the 2020-2021 season but for future seasons as well. Enjoy and thanks for reading! -Walter Hampton, Data Analyst
